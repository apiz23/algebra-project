# Algebra Project

This project demonstrates two main problems: Network Traffic Flow and Optimization of Manufacturing Production using Python libraries like NumPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib, PuLP, and PyFiglet.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```
.\install_library.bat
```
## Running the Project

To run the project, execute:
```
.\run.bat
```

## Features
Network Traffic Flow

- Calculates eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a traffic flow matrix.
- Visualizes the network graph with critical links highlighted.
- Computes optimal traffic flow using inverse matrix and Gauss-Jordan elimination.

Optimize Manufacturing Production

- Solves a linear programming problem to maximize profit.
- Visualizes the feasible region and optimal solution.
